BFP-ECS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Laravel 9](https://laravel.com/) - We use this for building the core web API services.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - An awesome UI component library based on ReactJS. It's lightweight too!
